                <br>Leaving the military isn’t just about taking off the uniform—it’s about stepping into a completely different world, one where the rules, expectations, and culture are unfamiliar. When I first started planning my transition, I knew I had valuable skills and experience, but I quickly realized that wasn’t enough. Translating years of military service into a civilian career isn’t as simple as listing out accomplishments on a resume. It requires strategy, networking, organization, and a mindset shift. That’s where Anaizat came in.
                <br>Anaizat, a former Navy service member, has been instrumental in helping me approach my transition with structure and intent. From day one, she encouraged me to move beyond the passive approach of submitting applications and waiting for a response. Instead, she helped me take ownership of my transition—identifying my strengths, refining my goals, and building a deliberate path toward my next career.
                <br><br>One of the biggest challenges I faced was networking. In the military, we don’t "network" in the way civilians do. We rely on rank structure, formal processes, and a clear chain of command. The idea of reaching out to strangers on LinkedIn, setting up informational interviews, and advocating for myself in professional circles felt foreign. Anaizat not only demystified the process but also led by example. She’s worked for some of the very companies I’m applying to, and she used her experience to open doors I wouldn’t have been able to on my own.
                <br><br>She didn’t just provide names or connections—she taught me how to navigate these conversations with confidence. She helped me prepare for calls, refine my pitch, and approach each interaction as a two-way street, where I wasn’t just asking for help but offering value as well. She made me see that networking isn’t about asking for favors—it’s about building relationships.
                <br><br>Beyond the logistics of job searching, Anaizat helped me shift my mindset. At times, the transition process felt overwhelming—like I was trying to prove my worth all over again. She reminded me that I wasn’t starting from scratch. My military experience had already equipped me with leadership skills, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities that companies actively seek. I just needed to learn how to articulate those skills in a way that resonated with civilian employers.
                <br><br>She also helped me take control of an area that many transitioning service members overlook: salary negotiation. The military operates on a structured pay scale where raises and promotions follow a set timeline. In the civilian world, salary is far more flexible, but only if you know how to advocate for yourself. Anaizat walked me through the negotiation process, showing me how to research industry salary ranges, frame my experience in a way that justified higher compensation, and confidently push for a number that reflected my true worth. Without her guidance, I might have accepted the first offer without realizing I had the power to negotiate for something better.
                <br><br>On top of all this, she helped me bring order to the chaos of transitioning. Between job applications, networking calls, interview prep, and researching companies, it was easy to feel overwhelmed. Anaizat introduced me to a structured approach using Microsoft OneDrive and custom Excel spreadsheets to track everything. With her system, I could easily organize my target companies, application deadlines, interview notes, follow-up actions, and salary research all in one place. What once felt like an unmanageable process suddenly became clear and strategic.
                <br><br>There were moments of doubt, where imposter syndrome crept in and I questioned whether I was doing enough or moving fast enough. Anaizat was there to remind me that transition is a marathon, not a sprint. She reinforced the importance of patience, persistence, and trusting the process.
                <br><br>I haven’t landed my next role yet, but I’m no longer navigating this journey blindly. Thanks to Anaizat’s guidance, I have a clearer direction, stronger connections, a better-organized approach, and a more confident stance in salary discussions. She has been more than just a mentor—she’s been a true advocate, a strategist, and a steady source of support.
                <br><br>Transitioning out of the military is never easy, but with the right people in your corner, it becomes less daunting. I’m grateful to have Anaizat in mine.
