                        <p class="lead">Let’s be honest—transitioning is overwhelming.
                            <br><br>Sure, we’ve faced pressure before 
                            (deployments, promotions, etc), but entering civilian life comes with a different flavor of anxiety: 
                            building resumes, networking, interviews, etc.
                            <br><br>Instead, you’re left navigating an endless sea of LinkedIn posts about networking, 
                            certifications, and “following your passion.”
                            <br><br>This page is my way of showing that you don’t have to do it alone. 
                            <br><br>It’s my AAR (After Action Report)—but without the jargon (okay, maybe a little).
